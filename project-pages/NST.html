        <div class="project-details-content">
          <div class="body-text">Neural style transfer (NST) is a technique that blends the content of one image (named content image)
            with the style of another image (named style image) using neural networks. The goal of the neural style
            transfer algorithm is to take a content image and a style image, then produce a new image that retains the
            content of the original image but has the artistic style of the style image.
          </div> 
          <div class="body-text"> As shown in papers, traditional CNNs methods cannot capture long-range dependencies owing to the limited
            receptive field of convolution operation, while simply adopting single encoder-decoder transformer
            architecture in NST tasks will face the issue of inability of fully capturing the content and the style of
            images. In contrast, StyTr2 adopted two different transformer encoders to generate domain-specific
            sequences for content and style respectively and a multi-layer transformer decoder to stylize the content
            sequence according to the style sequence, acquiring better results than other transformer-based methods.</div>
          <div class="body-text"> Inspired by StyTr2, we adopt the main architecture and replace the content and style encoders with the
            pretrained ViT model. We propose a two-stage training strategy, where we first freeze the pretrained
            encoders, and just train the decoder; then we wrap the encoders with LoRA and do joint training.</div>

        <div class="project-details-content">
          <div class="body-text">Our contributions are mainly four-fold:
            <ul>
              <li><b>Better image quality:</b> through the incorporation of pretrained models and LoRA, our model
                performs better than other baselines in terms of both content loss and style loss, with the style loss
                nearly half of the baselines.
              </li>
              <li><b>Less training computation:</b> the two-stage training strategy reduces the required training
                computation significantly, only less than half of the training computation required by the original
                StyTr2 model.
              </li>
              <li><b>Comprehensive ablation study:</b> we have tried different sets of hyperparameters to explore how
                LoRA and the pretrained model configuration affect the model performance.
