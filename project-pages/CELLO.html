        <div class="project-details-content">
          <div class="body-text">Large language models (LLMs) can understand human instructions, showing their potential for pragmatic applications beyond traditional NLP tasks. 
            However, they still struggle with complex instructions, which can be either complex task descriptions that require multiple tasks and constraints, or complex input that contains long context, noise, heterogeneous information and multi-turn format. 
            Due to these features, LLMs often ignore semantic constraints from task descriptions, generate incorrect formats, violate length or sample count constraints, and be unfaithful to the input text. 
            Existing benchmarks are insufficient to assess LLMs' ability to understand complex instructions, as they are close-ended and simple.
          </div> 
          <div class="body-text"> To bridge this gap, we propose CELLO, a benchmark for evaluating LLMs’ ability to follow complex instructions systematically. We design eight features for complex instructions and construct a comprehensive evaluation
            dataset from real-world scenarios. We also establish four criteria and develop corresponding metrics, as current ones are
            inadequate, biased or too strict and coarse-grained. We compare the performance of representative Chinese-oriented and
            English-oriented models in following complex instructions
            through extensive experiments.

          <div class="body-text">Our contributions are mainly four-fold:
            <ul>
              <li>To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to systematically investigate the ability of LLMs to follow complex
                instructions. We propose a comprehensive set of features
                for complex instructions, facilitating both dataset construction and evaluation criteria design.
              </li>
              <li>We construct a complex instruction dataset from realworld scenarios, containing 523 samples encompassing
                nine tasks, effectively covering our specified features.
                Specifically, we propose a two-stage framework for constructing the evaluation dataset for LLM’s complex instruction understanding.

              <li>
                We design four evaluation criteria and their automatic
                metrics for assessing LLMs’ ability to follow complex
                instructions in a comprehensive and discriminative way.
              </li>
