In modern control theory and practice, controlling complex and unknown chaotic systems remains a challenge. Particularly when the intrinsic mechanisms of these systems are difficult to obtain and when control strategies can hardly be physically validated, designing effective and efficient control paradigms becomes an essential issue. This work explores the use of reservoir computing as digital twins of such unknown systems, providing a validation carrier and achieving effective control through the use of only observational data. With numerical experiments, it is verified that a series of control strategies can be implemented to steer the target system towards the desired dynamics. The controlled objectives range from low to high-dimensional chaotic systems, with which traditional strategies struggle, including classic linear methods and advanced nonlinear and time-sensitive controls. We validate the effectiveness of these digital twins in replicating unknown complex systems and further demonstrate how to select and implement appropriate control strategies based on the specific requirements. This approach brings new insights to the field of data-driven control and offers new tools for designing practical control strategies.
